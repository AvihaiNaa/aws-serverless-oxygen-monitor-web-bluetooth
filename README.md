# aws-serverless-oxygen-monitor-web-bluetooth

This is an example application for interacting with bluetooth pulse oximeters using an AWS Amplify web front-end and AWS Serverless backend. The Amplify front-end uses web bluetooth to interact with the device and make calls to the backend to store a user's oxygen levels and pulse rate in an Amazon DynamoDB table.
